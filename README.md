# Hot Potato

Hot Potato is a Python program that assists job-searching developers in keeping their GitHub heat map as active as they want it to appear. Realistically GitHub's heat map is not a metric that hiring managers should be using to vet potential employees, but realistically some of them will. So job searching developers should prepare and use this app to keep their heat map hot!

## Installation
* Download [hot_potato.py](www.google.com)
* Create a new GitHub repository
* Place hot_potato.py inside the repository
* By default you are prompted for a min and max # of contributions every time you run the program, if you would like to set the numbers once and be done with it replace the # symbol in lines 13 and 14 with your min and max contributions respectively, and then insert them into lines 15 and 16
* Right click inside your repository and click open in terminal
* Run python hot_potato.py in the terminal
```
python hot_potato.py
```
